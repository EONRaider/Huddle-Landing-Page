## My process

1. I started with the markup on index.html, complying with HTML5 semantic tags and standards as much as possible.
2. The styling provided by the project briefing was implemented first, followed by the classes I came up with on the
   markup.
3. I used Figma to acquire all the right dimensions involved in the layout and implemented them in the appropriate CSS
   classes.
4. The [CSS Cube](https://cube.fyi/) methodology was used when coding the stylesheet and some of the conventions from
   BEM were used when naming classes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Cube CSS methodology

### What I learned

- I understood and edited the attributes of an SVG for the first time. There is a significant difference between the
  files provided by Frontend Mentor and the ones used in the final solutions. Pycharm Pro has a live preview feature
  that makes this editing a lot easier than when one is limited to browser dev tools.
